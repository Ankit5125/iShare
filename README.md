# iShare

**iShare** — A Flutter-based cross-platform app for sharing (files / content / links). *(Replace this with an accurate tagline describing what your app actually does.)*

---

## 📥 Download / Demo

You provided a build — use it to test the app on a device:

**APK / Build:** [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gYu3bLGlLzKXSwzEm8ym-3I3HN7LDk-/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gYu3bLGlLzKXSwzEm8ym-3I3HN7LDk-/view?usp=sharing)

*(Add screenshots and a short demo GIF here after you run the APK.)*

---

## 🖼️ Screenshots

Put screenshots in `assets/screenshots/` and reference them below. Example (replace with your images):

```markdown
![Home screen](assets/images/home.png)
![Send screen](assets/images/send.png)
![Web Share View](assets/images/QR.png)
![Web Share View](assets/images/cat.png)
![Computer Screen View](assets/images/computer.png)
```

> **Tip:** Use `assets/screenshots/README.md` or the `screenshots` folder in repo root; keep file names descriptive (e.g. `home_send_receive.png`).

---

## 🚀 Features (fill these with exact features from your app)

* Share files over local network / Wi‑Fi (example)
* Send / receive files with progress indicator
* Select multiple files from device storage
* Save received files to a dedicated folder
* Cross-platform support: Android, iOS, Web (if implemented)
* \[Add any auth, user profiles, or cloud sync features here]

## 🧩 What I noticed in the repository

*(This is an automated scan summary — update with specifics.)*

* Standard Flutter project structure with platform folders: `android/`, `ios/`, `linux/`, `macos/`, `web/`, `windows/`.
* `lib/` folder present — that's where the Dart code lives.
* Assets and launcher icons config files are present (`assets/`, `flutter_launcher_icons.yaml`).
* `pubspec.yaml` and `pubspec.lock` files exist — they define dependencies and assets.
* The repository currently contains an initial README. Replace this file with the one below to give users a better entrypoint.

## 🛠️ Quick start — run locally

**Prerequisites**

* Flutter SDK (stable channel) installed and on your `PATH`.
* Android Studio / Xcode for emulators / device builds.
* (Optional) Set up Android device for USB debugging or use an emulator.

**Clone**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ankit5125/iShare.git
cd iShare
```

**Install dependencies**

```bash
flutter pub get

**Run on connected device / emulator**

```bash
flutter run
```

**Build APK**

## 🗂️ Project structure (top-level)

```
.iShare/
├── android/
├── ios/
├── lib/                # Dart source files
├── assets/             # images, fonts, screenshots
├── web/
├── test/
├── pubspec.yaml
├── pubspec.lock
├── flutter_launcher_icons.yaml
└── README.md
```

*(Adjust the structure above if you use other folders or micro-packages.)*

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Open `pubspec.yaml` and paste the `dependencies:` section here so the README can list exact packages and versions. Example format:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
  provider: ^6.0.0
  http: ^0.13.4
  path_provider: ^2.0.11
```

## 🔐 App signing & release notes

If you plan to publish on Google Play:

* Configure signing in `android/app/build.gradle` and `key.properties`.
* Create a release keystore and keep the key safe.
* Update version in `pubspec.yaml` (`version: 1.0.0+1`).

---

## ✅ Tests

Place your unit and widget tests in `/test`. Run tests with:

## 👨‍💻 How I can help next

I created this README template and added notes based on the repository structure. I can also:

* Replace placeholders with exact features, dependency list, and code snippets **if you paste the `pubspec.yaml` and `lib/` entry files here**.
* Create a ready-to-commit `README.md` and show the exact `git` commands to add & push it to your repo.
* Generate a small `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` if you want.

### Scan / automation notes

I scanned the repository structure and found the core Flutter directories and metadata files. If you want a README that lists exact packages, routes, and screen-by-screen descriptions, paste your `pubspec.yaml`, `lib/main.dart`, and `lib/` screens or allow me to fetch the raw files and I'll auto-fill everything for you.
